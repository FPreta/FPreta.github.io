Abstract:
One of Bers' most celebrated achievements is the simultaneous uniformization of Riemann surfaces. As an immediate consequence of his construction, one obtains a canonical (up to a choice of base point) embedding of the Teichmuller space of Riemann surfaces of genus g and n punctures, as a domain of holomorphy in a complex linear space of dimension 3g-3+n. In his paper “Finite dimensional Teichmüller spaces and generalizations" he also announces a similar theorem for deformation spaces, analogues of Teichmuller spaces in which homotopy classes of homeomorphisms are replaced by deformations. Those are maps between nodal Riemann surfaces, which are generically one-to-one, except for possibly retracting some loops onto nodes. In my talk I will present a proof of this theorem, based on a construction with Kleinian groups. As the outline was sketched in the aforementioned paper, I will present a more detailed and complete account. This is a joint work with F. Buonerba.
