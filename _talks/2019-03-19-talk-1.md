Abstract:
A closed geodesic in the moduli space of a genus g surface is said to be L-short if its length is bounded  by L/(2g-2). Each of these curves corresponds to a pseudo-Anosov element of the mapping class group with short dilatation. Farb, Leininger and Margalit proved that for a fixed L there is only a finite number of mapping tori with such monodromy. In this way, building on results by Thurston and Fried, such 3-manifolds can be used to construct families of examples for short geodesics of different genus. Motivated by understanding their location in moduli spaces, this talk will provide an explicit method to analyze the topology and geometry of families of surfaces obtained from the same mapping torus. In order to do so, I will build on results by McMullen on their covering spaces and I will propose examples to show proper bounds on their geometry.
