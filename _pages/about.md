I am a fifth year PhD in Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU. My research interests lie in Hyperbolic Geometry and Topology, with an eye on applications to Unsupervised Learning and Data Embeddings. I am currently working on my doctoral dissertation about fibrations of compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds under the supervision of Prof. Robert Young.
